# This file tests the end-to-end behavior of the --diff-with option in generate-prompt.sh.
# It creates a temporary Git repository, commits a file with a valid TODO instruction,
# then either modifies it (to produce diff output) or resets it (so no diff appears),
# and finally asserts that the assembled prompt includes (or omits) a diff section accordingly.
