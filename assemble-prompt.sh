# assemble-prompt.sh
#
# This function assembles the final ChatGPT prompt by including:
#   - The contents of Swift (or other allowed) files where type definitions were found
#     (optionally filtered by substring markers), and
#   - A fixed instruction (ignoring the extracted TODO instruction).
#
# It takes two parameters:
#   1. <found_files_file>: A file (typically temporary) containing a list of file paths.
#   2. <instruction_content>: The TODO instruction content (now ignored).
#
# The function outputs the final assembled prompt to stdout and also copies it
# to the clipboard using pbcopy.
#
# If the environment variable DIFF_WITH_BRANCH is set (for example by running:
#   generate-prompt.sh --diff-with develop
# then for each file that differs from that branch, a diff report is appended after the file's content.

# Determine the directory where this script resides.
