# GetThePrompt

Bash script that turns your `TODO`'s into prompts by smartly including the **surrounding context**.

## Installation

TBD

## How It Works

Copies a ChatGPT-friendly prompt to your **clipboard** by:

1. Finding your most recent `// TODO: - `,
2. Identifying all associated classes, structs, enums, etc.,
3. Including these definitions in your prompt for context,
4. Copying the complete prompt to your clipboard.

This ensures your prompt contains **exactly** the information needed for ChatGPT to provide a **relevant answer**.

## Caveats

- Currently supports **Swift** only.
- This script is a work in progress.
- You must write your question in the form // TODO: - (including the hyphen) or // TODO: ChatGPT: . This prevents the script from accidentally picking up all your TODOs.
- It handles only one question at a time. Multiple questions can confuse ChatGPT.
- The script uses a simple method to identify “types” (classes, protocols, enums, etc.) by scanning for capitalized words, then searching for their definitions.
- It produces several temporary files, which can add some clutter.
- This script was largely generated by ChatGPT. Although it works for my use case, there may still be bugs.
